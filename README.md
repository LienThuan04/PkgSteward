## Overview

Manager NPM runs entirely on your own machine: a NestJS API and a Next.js web UI. It is meant to answer questions like
*"which projects do I have, what do they depend on, what is outdated, how much disk do their `node_modules` take?"*
and to perform common chores (install/update packages, delete `node_modules`, switch package manager or Node.js
versions) safely.

- **Local and single-user by design:** no accounts, no authentication, no database. Data is read from the
  filesystem at the time of each request.
- **Safety first:** every destructive or machine-wide action goes through a *preview → confirm* flow.

## Requirements

- Windows 11
- Node.js 24 (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc))
- pnpm 11

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LienThuan04/Manager-NPM.git
cd Manager-NPM
cd manager_npm_be && pnpm install && cd ..
cd manager_npm_fe && pnpm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Configure

Copy `manager_npm_be/.env.example` to `manager_npm_be/.env` and set `SCAN_ROOT_PATHS`. Main variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MODE` | `development` | `development` enables Swagger |
| `HOST`, `PORT` | `localhost`, `8080` | Listen address |
| `GLOBAL_PREFIX`, `VERSION` | `api`, `1` | URL prefix, e.g. `/api/v1` |
| `LIST_ORIGIN_CORS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend origin allowed by CORS |
| `SCAN_ROOT_PATHS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated root folders to scan; also the path allowlist |
| `MAX_SCAN_DEPTH` | `4` | Maximum folder depth when scanning |
| `NPM_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Timeout for npm / pnpm / Yarn commands |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The API has no authentication by design. Keep `HOST=localhost` and do not expose it to a network.

### 3. Run

Double-click a script in the repository root, or run it from a terminal:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `start-dev.bat` | Starts the backend and the frontend in development mode (watch / hot reload) |
| `start-prod.bat` | Builds both apps, then starts them in production mode (`MODE=production`, Swagger off) |

Each app opens in its own window; press `Ctrl+C` or close the window to stop it. If `node_modules` is missing, the
scripts install dependencies first. The commands they run are set at the top of each file.

| | URL |
|---|---|
| Web UI | http://localhost:3000 |
| API | http://localhost:8080/api/v1 |
| Swagger (development only) | http://localhost:8080/swagger |

To run an app on its own, use the scripts below inside its folder.

## Scripts

| App | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | `pnpm dev` | Start with watch mode |
| | `pnpm build` / `pnpm start:prod` | Compile to `dist/` / run the compiled build |
| | `pnpm lint` | ESLint (auto-fix) |
| | `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:e2e` | Unit / end-to-end tests (Jest) |
| Frontend | `pnpm dev` | Start the Next.js dev server |
| | `pnpm build` / `pnpm start` | Production build / serve it |
| | `pnpm lint` | ESLint |
| | `pnpm theme:check` | Check WCAG AA contrast of the theme tokens |
| | `pnpm i18n:check` | Compare each locale's keys with the default locale (`vi`): extra keys fail, missing keys only warn |

## Project structure

```
manager_npm_be/    Backend API (NestJS 11)
manager_npm_fe/    Web UI (Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, next-intl)
start-dev.bat      Run both apps in development mode
start-prod.bat     Build and run both apps in production mode
```

The two apps are independent pnpm projects, each with its own lockfile. There is no root `package.json`.
