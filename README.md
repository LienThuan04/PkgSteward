## What it is

Manager NPM runs entirely on your own machine: a NestJS API (port `8080`) and a Next.js UI (port `3000`).
It is meant to answer questions like *"which projects do I have, what do they depend on, what is outdated,
how much disk do their `node_modules` take?"* and to perform common chores (install/update packages, delete
`node_modules`, switch package manager or Node.js versions) safely.

- **Local and single-user by design:** no accounts, no authentication, no database. Data is read from the
  filesystem at the time of each request.
- **Safety first:** every destructive or machine-wide action goes through a *preview → confirm* flow.

## Status

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Backend foundation: NestJS 11, env validation, global exception filter, response/logging interceptors, pagination helpers, Swagger, rate limiting, tests | ✅ Done |
| Frontend foundation: Next.js 16 + React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components, light/dark/system theme, i18n (English/Vietnamese), app shell | ✅ Done |
| Frontend design-system showcase page (`/design-system`) | 🚧 In progress |
| Feature modules (see Roadmap) | 📋 Planned |

## Roadmap

| # | Module | What it will do | Safety |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Scanner | Find Node.js projects (`package.json`) under the configured root folders | Read-only |
| 4.2 | Projects | Analyze one project: dependencies, outdated packages, vulnerabilities | Read-only |
| 4.3 | npm runner | Run `install` / `update` / `uninstall` / scripts inside a project, with streamed output | Scoped to the project |
| 4.4 | File operations | Folder tree with checkboxes; delete `node_modules`, files, folders or a whole project | Preview → confirm |
| 4.5 | Disk usage | Folder sizes and per-package breakdown of `node_modules` | Read-only, cached |
| 4.6 | Global packages | List, update and remove global packages (npm / pnpm / Yarn) | Preview → confirm |
| 4.7 | Package manager versions | Manage npm / pnpm / Yarn versions per project or globally (Corepack) | Preview → confirm |
| 4.8 | Node.js versions | Switch the active Node.js version through nvm-windows | Preview → confirm (machine-wide) |

All modules are **planned**.

## Safety model

These rules are part of the design. Every module that changes files or the environment must follow them:

- **Preview → confirm:** the module exposes a `preview` endpoint that lists exactly what will happen and an
  `execute` endpoint that requires explicit confirmation. The UI always shows the preview first.
- **Path allowlist:** every path coming from the client is resolved (including symlinks / junctions) and must be
  inside `SCAN_ROOT_PATHS`.
- **No shell string building:** external commands run through `execa` with argument arrays and a timeout.
- **Local only:** the API has no authentication by design. Keep `HOST=localhost`; do not expose it to a network.

## Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 11 is the primary target. Development also works on other systems, but some planned features
  (nvm-windows integration) are Windows-only.
- **Node.js 24** (see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc))
- **pnpm 11** (the only supported package manager)

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LienThuan04/Manager-NPM.git
cd Manager-NPM

# Backend: http://localhost:8080/api/v1 (Swagger: http://localhost:8080/swagger)
cd manager_npm_be
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env      # then set SCAN_ROOT_PATHS
pnpm dev

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (in a second terminal)
cd manager_npm_fe
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The two apps are independent pnpm projects, each with its own lockfile. There is no root `package.json`.

### Backend configuration

Copy `manager_npm_be/.env.example` to `.env`. Main variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MODE` | `development` | `development` enables Swagger |
| `HOST`, `PORT` | `localhost`, `8080` | Listen address |
| `GLOBAL_PREFIX`, `VERSION` | `api`, `1` | URL prefix, e.g. `/api/v1` |
| `LIST_ORIGIN_CORS` | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend origin allowed by CORS |
| `SCAN_ROOT_PATHS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated root folders to scan; also the path allowlist |
| `MAX_SCAN_DEPTH` | `4` | Maximum folder depth when scanning |
| `NPM_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` | Timeout for npm / pnpm / Yarn commands |

## Scripts

| App | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | `pnpm dev` | Start with watch mode |
| | `pnpm lint` | ESLint (auto-fix) |
| | `pnpm build` | Compile to `dist/` |
| | `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:e2e` | Unit / end-to-end tests (Jest) |
| Frontend | `pnpm dev` | Start Next.js dev server |
| | `pnpm lint` | ESLint |
| | `pnpm build` | Production build |
| | `pnpm theme:check` | Check WCAG AA contrast of the theme tokens |
| | `pnpm i18n:check` | Compare each locale's keys with the default locale (`vi`): extra keys fail, missing keys only warn |
