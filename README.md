## Overview

PkgSteward runs entirely on your own machine: a NestJS API and a Next.js web UI. It is meant to answer questions like
*"which projects do I have, what do they depend on, what is outdated, how much disk do their `node_modules` take?"*
and to perform common chores (install/update packages, delete `node_modules`, pin a project's package
manager version) safely.

- **Local and single-user by design:** no accounts, no authentication, no database. Data is read from the
  filesystem at the time of each request.
- **Safety first:** file deletions and machine-wide changes go through a *preview → confirm* flow; project
  commands (below) start in one click next to a permanent trust notice.
- **Project commands:** run install/update/uninstall or a declared script from project details with npm 10–12 or
  pnpm 10–11, live logs and Stop; workspace members support scripts only. Run starts in one click without confirmation.

> [!WARNING]
> Only run projects you trust. Commands execute project/lifecycle code and configuration (`.npmrc`, pnpmfile,
> plugins) with your user rights and no sandbox; they may use the network, shared stores and files outside the
> project. Logs may reveal secrets. There is no rollback; stopped/failed runs may leave partial changes. Stop
> may miss processes that escape the tracked tree, and a junction swap at launch is not fully prevented.
> See [Command runner API](apps/api/README.md#command-runner-api) for tool/config limits and cleanup behavior.

## Requirements

- Windows 11
- Node.js 22.18 or newer (tested on Node 22 and 24; development uses Node 24, see [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc)). Older Node prints a warning at startup and may fail to run.
- pnpm 11 (recommended), pnpm 10, npm or Yarn 1

## Getting started

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LienThuan04/PkgSteward.git
cd PkgSteward

# Run one of these at the repository root; it installs both apps/api and apps/web for each package manager you use (run only one of the following three commands):
pnpm install
npm install
yarn install
```

The root install runs the same package manager inside `apps/api` and `apps/web`. Only pnpm reads the
committed `pnpm-lock.yaml` files, which pin the tested versions. npm and Yarn resolve the newest versions
allowed by each `package.json`, and the lockfiles they create are not committed.

### 2. Configure

Copy `apps/api/.env.example` to `apps/api/.env` and set `SCAN_ROOT_PATHS`. Main variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MODE` | `development` | `development` enables Swagger |
| `HOST`, `PORT` | `127.0.0.1`, `24681` | Listen address; `HOST` must be a loopback address (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `::1`) |
| `GLOBAL_PREFIX`, `VERSION` | `api`, `1` | URL prefix, e.g. `/api/v1` |
| `LIST_ORIGIN_CORS` | `http://localhost:24680` | Frontend origin allowed by CORS |
| `SCAN_ROOT_PATHS` | `*` | Comma-separated absolute root folders to scan (e.g. `D:\Projects`), or `*` (also when empty) for every local fixed drive; `*` must be used alone. Also the path allowlist (system folders are always excluded) |
| `MAX_SCAN_DEPTH` | `0` | Maximum folder depth below each scan root (below each drive root for `*`); `0` means no limit |
| `SCAN_TIMEOUT_MS` | (empty) | No time limit; set milliseconds (minimum `1000`) to stop a scan after that long |
| `PKGSTEWARD_DATA_DIR` | `PkgStewardLog` | Folder for runtime data (logs, cache, `settings.json`): an absolute path, or a path relative to the project folder. The default is a `PkgStewardLog` folder inside the project folder |
| `NPM_COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS` | (empty) | No time limit; set milliseconds (minimum `1000`) to stop an npm / pnpm / Yarn command after that long |

Values in settings.json inside the data folder override environment variables.

Frontend variables go in `apps/web/.env.local` or `apps/web/.env` (copy the frontend's `.env.example`):

| Variable | Default when empty or unset | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `24680` | Frontend listen port; decimal integer from `1` to `65535` |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Frontend listen host; only `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `::1` |
| `API_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:24681/api/v1` | Server-only backend URL; must match the backend address |

For frontend `PORT`/`HOST`, the first nonempty value wins: real environment → `.env.local` → `.env` → default.
Whitespace-only values count as empty; invalid values stop startup. When changing the frontend `PORT` or `HOST`,
update the backend's `LIST_ORIGIN_CORS` to match the origin used in the browser (for example,
`http://localhost:24680`). When changing the backend `PORT` or `HOST`, update the frontend's `API_BASE_URL`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The API has no authentication by design. Keep `HOST` on a loopback address (default `127.0.0.1`) and do not expose it to a network.

### 3. Run

Start both apps from the repository root, with the package manager you installed with:

```bash
pnpm dev        # or: npm run dev / yarn dev
```

Both apps run in one terminal; each output line starts with `[api]` or `[web]`. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop both.
If one app stops (for example, because of an invalid `.env` value), the other one is stopped too.

For production, set `MODE=production` in `apps/api/.env` (Swagger off), then run at the repository root:

```bash
pnpm build      # or: npm run build / yarn build (builds apps/api, then apps/web)
pnpm start      # or: npm start / yarn start (runs start:prod in apps/api and start in apps/web)
```

`start` opens the web UI in your default browser once both apps are ready (one tab per run; `dev` never opens one).
Set `PKGSTEWARD_NO_BROWSER=1` to skip it.

You can still run an app on its own inside its folder, for example `cd apps/api && pnpm dev`.

| | URL |
|---|---|
| Web UI | http://localhost:24680 |
| API | http://localhost:24681/api/v1 |
| Swagger (development only) | http://localhost:24681/swagger |

Root scripts run both apps; the other scripts below run inside the app's folder. With npm, use `npm run <script>`; with
Yarn, `yarn <script>`.

## Scripts

| App | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Root | `pnpm install` | Install both apps |
| | `pnpm dev` | Start both apps in development mode |
| | `pnpm build` / `pnpm start` | Build both apps / run both production builds |
| Backend | `pnpm dev` | Start with watch mode |
| | `pnpm build` / `pnpm start:prod` | Compile to `dist/` / run the compiled build |
| | `pnpm lint` | ESLint (auto-fix) |
| | `pnpm test` / `pnpm test:e2e` | Unit / end-to-end tests (Jest) |
| Frontend | `pnpm dev` | Start the Next.js dev server |
| | `pnpm build` / `pnpm start` | Production build / serve it |
| | `pnpm lint` | ESLint |
| | `pnpm theme:check` | Check WCAG AA contrast of the theme tokens |
| | `pnpm i18n:check` | Compare each locale's keys with the default locale (`vi`): extra keys fail, missing keys only warn |

## Project structure

```
apps/api/          Backend API (NestJS 12)
apps/web/          Web UI (Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, next-intl)
scripts/           Repository scripts (root install and run, third-party notices)
package.json       Root scripts: install, run and build both apps
```

The two apps are independent pnpm projects, each with its own lockfile. The root `package.json` has no
dependencies; it only installs, runs and builds both apps with the package manager you call it with.
